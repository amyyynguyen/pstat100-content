    "# Lab 2: Sampling design and statistical bias\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following scenarios you'll explore through simulation how nonrandom sampling can produce datasets with statistical properties that are distored relative to the population that the sample was drawn from. This kind of distortion is known as **bias**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In common usage, the word 'bias' means disproportion or unfairness. In statistics, the concept has the same connotation -- biased sampling favors certain observational units over others, and biased estimates are estimates that favor larger or smaller values than the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab has you explore sampling bias. The goal is to refine your understanding about what (statistical) bias is and is not, and develop your intuition about potential mechanisms by which bias is introduced and the effect that this can have on sample statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simulate biased and unbiased sampling designs\n",
    "* Examine the impact of sampling bias on the sample mean\n",
    "* Apply a simple bias correction by inverse probability weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling design\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sampling design** of a study refers to _**the way observational units are selected**_ from the sampling frame (the collection of all observable units). Any design can be expressed by the probability that each unit is included in the sample. In a random sample, all units are equally likely to be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to learn about U.S. residents (population), but only be able for ethical reasons to study adults (sampling frame), and decide to do a mail survey of 2000 randomly selected addresses in each state (sampling design). (This is not a random sample of all individuals because individuals share addresses and the population sizes are different from state to state.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, **bias** describes _**the 'typical' deviation of a sample statistic (observed) from its population counterpart (unobserved)**_. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a particular sampling design tends to produce an average measurement around 1.5 units, but the true average in the population is 2 units, then the estimate has a bias of -0.5 units. The language 'typical' and 'tends to' is important here. Estimates are rarely (almost never) perfect, so just because an estimate is off by -0.5 units for one sample doesn't make it biased -- it is only biased if it is *consistently* off under repeated sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although bias is technically a property of a sample statistic (like the sample average), it's common to talk about a biased *sample* -- this term refers to a dataset collected using a sampling design that produces biased statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what you'll explore in this lab -- the relationship between sampling design and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be simulating data in this lab. **Simulation** is a great means of exploration for the present topic _**because you can control the population properties**_. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with real data, you just have one dataset, and you don't know any of the properties of the population or what might have happened if a different sample were collected. That makes it difficult to understand sampling variation and impossible to directly compare the sample properties to the population properties! \n",
    "\n",
    "With simulated data, by contrast, you control how data are generated with exact precision -- so by extension, you know everything there is to know about the population. In addition, repeated simulation of data makes it possible to explore the typical behavior of a particular sampling design, so you can learn 'what usually happens' for a particular sampling design by direct observation.\n",

    "These simulations illustrate through a few simple examples that random sampling -- a sampling design where each unit is equally likely to be selected -- produces unbiased sample means. That means that 'typical samples' will yield sample averages that are close to the population value. By contrast, deviations from random sampling tend to yield biased sample averages -- in other words, nonrandom sampling tends to distort the statistical properties of the population in ways that can produce misleading conclusions (if uncorrected).\n",

    "\n",
    "* bias is not a property of an individual sample, but of a *sampling design*\n",
    "    - unbiased sampling designs tend to produce faithful representations of populations\n",
    "    - but there are no guarantees for individual samples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* if you hadn't known the population distributions, there would have been no computational method to detect bias\n",
    "    - in practice, it's necessary to *reason* about whether the sampling design is sound\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* the sample statistic (sample mean) was only reliable when the sampling design was sound\n",
