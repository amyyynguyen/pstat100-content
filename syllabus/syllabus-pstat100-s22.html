            <h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1>
<p>PSTAT100 is a hands-on introduction to data science intended for intermediate-level students from any discipline with some exposure to probability and basic computing skills, but few or no upper-division courses in statistics or computer science. The course introduces central concepts in statistics -- such as sampling variation, uncertainty, and inference -- in an applied setting together with techniques for data exploration and analysis. Course activities model standard data science workflow practices by example, and successful students acquire programming skills, project management skills, and subject exposure that will serve them well in upper-division courses as well as in independent research or projects.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>Successful students will establish foundational data science skills: critical assessment of data quality and sampling design; inspection and tidying of raw data; exploratory, descriptive, visual, and inferential analysis; and interpretation and communication of results for a general audience.</p>
<p>These skills will be discussed in depth during course lectures; students will practice them through lab activities, homework assignments, and project work.</p>
<h2 id="catalog-desciption-and-prerequisites">Catalog desciption and prerequisites</h2>
<p>Overview of data science key concepts and the use of tools for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and reproducible research. Topics include an introduction to inference and prediction, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality, statistical &quot;traps&quot;, and concepts in data ethics and privacy. Case studies will illustrate the importance of domain knowledge. Prerequisites: Probability and Statistics I (PSTAT 120A), Linear Algebra (MATH 4A), and prior experience with Python or another programming language (CMPSC 9 or CMPSC 16). Credit units: 4.</p>
<h2 id="course-staff-and-roles">Course staff and roles</h2>
<p>Instructor: Trevor Ruiz
Teaching assistants: Blythe King and Jeff Wu
Learning assistants: Annie Huang, Dante Coletta, and Priyanka Banerjee</p>
<p>The instructor is primarily responsible for delivering lectures and course administration. The teaching assistants are primarily responsible for providing lab instruction and managing assessments and course pages. The learning assistants are primarily responsible for providing assignment support to students. All staff hold regular office hours on a weekly basis open to all enrolled students.</p>
<p>In Spring 2022, lectures are offered asynchronously online; sections are held as scheduled on GOLD; and office hours are held via Zoom.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>The course GauchoSpace page will link to all course content and resources; this is accessible to enrolled students automatically via <a href="https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/">https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/</a> using their UCSB credentials. </p>
<p>The course will progress according to the following weekly pattern: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mondays</strong> at 8am : week&#39;s content released.</li><li><strong>Fridays</strong> at 11:59pm : assignment(s) due.</li></ul>
<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>
<p>Readings for the course will draw on multiple sources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/">Python Data Science Handbook</a>;</li><li><a href="http://www.textbook.ds100.org/intro.html">Berkeley&#39;s Data 100 course notes</a>;</li><li>collected journal articles distributed as assigned.</li></ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>Computing will be hosted at <a href="https://pstat100.lsit.ucsb.edu">pstat100.lsit.ucsb.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to install software needed to open, edit, and run notebooks on their own machine, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">a Python install</a>;</li><li><a href="https://jupyter.org/install">Jupyter</a>;</li><li>packages utilized in course materials (primarily numpy, pandas, altair, and scikit-learn).</li></ul>
<p>Managing package installations will require some (straightforward) use of the package installer <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code> in the command line to retrieve/install packages from the Python Package Index repository. Documentation for specific packages (or a Google search) will indicate the appropriate <code>pip</code> command.</p>
<p>For students familiar with (or wishing to become familiar with) GitHub, course materials are distributed from the public repository <a href="https://github.com/ucsb-stds-courses/pstat100-content">https://github.com/ucsb-stds-courses/pstat100-content</a>. Students can learn how to &#39;fork&#39; the repository (make a copy) and &#39;clone&#39; the fork (create local copies of repository files on a personal machine) in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">GitHub quickstart documentation</a>. There&#39;s not much sense in forking the course repo without also installing python and jupyter, as the latter will be needed to open most repository files locally. <em>Students working primarily locally from a repo fork should use Git to commit and push local changes to their fork as they complete coursework; <strong>failure to do so could result in partial or complete loss of work</strong></em>.</p>
<h2 id="assessments">Assessments</h2>
<p>Attainment of course learning outcomes will be measured by assessment of submitted work. Submitted work falls into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labs</strong> will be assigned weekly in most weeks. These are structured coding assignments with small exercises throughout that introduce the programming skills needed to complete homework assignments.</li><li><strong>Homeworks</strong> will be assigned biweekly. These are fairly involved assignments which apply concepts and techniques from the lectures and programming skills from the labs to real data sets in order to reproduce an analysis and answer substantive questions. Collaboration is encouraged, and group submissions will be allowed for groups of up to 3 students.</li><li><strong>Mini projects</strong> will be assigned biweekly in alternation with homeworks. These assignments prompt students to use skills from the course in an unstructured setting to answer high-level questions pertaining to one or more datasets. Mini projects should be completed individually, but discussion is permitted and encouraged.</li><li>A <strong>course project</strong> will be assigned requiring students to carry out an open-ended analysis of an independently chosen dataset. This will be completed in teams. Each team will prepare a project plan for initial feedback a few weeks before the end of the quarter, and submit a final report of work and findings by the end of the quarter.</li></ul>
<p>Overall scores in the course will be calculated for each student as the weighted average of scores on all submitted work; the relative weighting and letter grade assignments will depend entirely on the score distribution of the class as a whole and as such reflect each student&#39;s performance relative to their peers.</p>
<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>The tentative topic and assignment schedule is given below. All assignments are due by Friday 11:59pm in the week indicated; late submissions are allowed, with a possible penalty, through the following Monday at 11:59pm. </p>
<p>The schedule is subject to change based on the progress of the class.</p>

<h3 id="expected-time-commitment">Expected time commitment</h3>
<p>The course is 4 credit units; each credit unit corresponds to an approximate time commitment of 3 hours. So, students should expect to allocate 12 hours per week to the course on average. Course staff are available to help any students spending considerably more time on the class balance the workload.</p>
<h3 id="scores-and-grades">Scores and grades</h3>
<p>Scores on submitted work can be monitored on Gradescope to ensure fair assignment of course grades. On any individual assignment, re-evaluation can be requested within one week of receiving a score. Requests for re-evaluation made beyond one week after publication of scores may or may not be considered on a discretionary basis.</p>
<p>Determination of letter grade assignments is made entirely at the discretion of the instructor based on the assessments outlined above and consistent with university policy. Students are not permitted to negotiate their grades, and are discouraged from requesting audits, recalculations, or verification of self-calculations after the course has concluded. The instructor is under no obligation to share the details of grade calculations with students or to respond to such requests.</p>
<p>If at the end of the course a student believes their grade was unfairly assigned, either due to discrimination or without basis in coursework, they are entitled to contest it according to the procedure <a href="https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/AcademicPoliciesProcedures/ContestedGrades.aspx">outlined here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conduct">Conduct</h3>
<p>Students are expected to uphold the <a href="http://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/policies-procedures">student code of conduct</a> and to maintain integrity. All individually-submitted work must be an honest reflection of individual effort. Evidence of dishonest conduct will be discussed with the student(s) involved and reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC). Depending on the nature of the evidence and the violation, penalty in the course may range from a warning to loss of credit to automatic failure. For a definition and examples of dishonesty, a discussion of what constitutes an appropriate response from faculty, and an explanation of the reporting and investigation process, see the <a href="https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity">OSC page on academic integrity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="deadlines-and-late-work">Deadlines and late work</h3>
<p>Late work will not be accepted beyond 72 hours after the deadline for any assignment without prior approval. There is a one-hour grace period on all submission deadlines. After that, work submitted within 72 hours of the deadline will be evaluated for 75% credit.</p>
<p>Every student can submit two late assignments within 72 hours of the deadline without penalty. After the first two late submissions, the 75% penalty will be applied.</p>
<h3 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h3>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on <a href="https://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/">the DSP website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Toward the end of the term students will be given an opportunity to provide feedback about the course via ESCI. In addition, content-specific feedback will be collected for the Central Coast Data Science Partnership (CCDSP) at the end of the quarter. This information will be used to assess learning outcomes, understand student demographics, and plan further course development; input on the CCDSP survey is especially valuable, and a small amount of course credit will be offered for completion of this survey.</p>
