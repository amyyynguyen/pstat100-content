# Data science concepts and analysis (public)

This repository contains course files distributed to students enrolled in PSTAT100 at UCSB; primarily these comprise lecture slides and assignment files.

## Repository information

### Contributors 

All course materials were developed in Spring 2021 by Trevor Ruiz. Lab0 and Lab1 were adapted from materials written by Alex Franks and Kate Kharitonova for a pilot version of the course offered as INT15 in Spring 2020.

Assignment tests were developed and implemented by Priyanka Banerjee during Fall 2021 and Winter 2022.

Annie Huang and Dante Coletta contributed a list of suggested project datasets.

## Course information

PSTAT100 is a hands-on introduction to data science intended for intermediate-level students from any discipline with some exposure to probability and basic computing skills, but few or no upper-division courses in statistics or computer science. The course introduces central concepts in statistics -- such as sampling variation, uncertainty, and inference -- in an applied setting together with techniques for data exploration and analysis. Course activities model standard data science workflow practices by example, and successful students acquire programming skills, project management skills, and subject exposure that will serve them well in upper-division courses as well as in independent research or projects.

### Learning outcomes

Successful students will establish foundational data science practices: critical assessment of data quality and sampling design; inspection and tidying of raw data; exploratory, descriptive, visual, and inferential analysis; and interpretation and communication of results for a general audience.

Attainment of outcomes is measured by assessment of submitted lab activities, homework assignments, and guided and independent project work.

### Catalog desciption and prerequisites

Overview of data science key concepts and the use of tools for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and reproducible research. Topics include an introduction to inference and prediction, principles of measurement, missing data, and notions of causality, statistical "traps", and concepts in data ethics and privacy. Case studies will illustrate the importance of domain knowledge. Prerequisites: Probability and Statistics I (PSTAT 120A), Linear Algebra (MATH 4A), and prior experience with Python or another programming language (CMPSC 9 or CMPSC 16). Credit units: 4.
