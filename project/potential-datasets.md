## Potential Project Datasets

Again, you are welcome and encouraged to use data from any source, including data from the class meeting the requirements stated in the project description (though you should choose a different direction if so).

Here are a few trustworthy sources with interesting data:

* [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) contains a wealth of usually well-organized datasets comprising country indicators. I've used a variety of data from this source in class examples and labs.
* [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) and the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/data) publish open data related to climate and environment.
* The [CDC Data & Statistics portal](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html) links to a variety of health-related datasets.
* The [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) links to Department of Education data on secondary and higher education in the U.S.
* The state of California has an [open data portal](https://data.ca.gov/) with data provided by state agencies on energy, health, transportation, etc.
* The [Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) publishes many data products, although -- fair warning -- they are not the easiest to navigate and often contain overwhelming amounts of information.

You might also find inspiration and potential data sources from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), which contains a number of neat articles with nice visualizations organized by topic.

Lastly, there are some repositories out there like the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), though these often provide pretty minimal background about available data.

### Additional Potential Resources
